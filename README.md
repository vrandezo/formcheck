Formcheck is a static Website that allows to check whether the forms of a
Lexeme in Wikidata conforms to the paradigm provided by a function in
Wikifunctions.

It let's the user choose a language, a part of speech, the grammatical features
of the output form, and a function on Wikifunctions. It then checks whether the
function evaluating on the lemma indeed results in the output form.

You can select an arbitrary Z-id for the function, not just one from the given
list. You can also choose arbitrary Q-ids in all the above fields, although
the system tries to offer you sensible choices.
